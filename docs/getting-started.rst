Getting Started
===============

Live Demo
*********

If you'd like to check out a demo of DefectDojo before installing it, you can check out on our `Heroku demo site`_.

.. _Heroku demo site: https://defectdojo.herokuapp.com/

You can log in as an administrator like so:

* admin / defectdojo@demo#appsec

You can also log in as a product owner or non-staff user:

* product_manager / defectdojo@demo#product

Docker Compose Install
**********************

*You will need:*

* Latest version of Docker
* Latest version Docker Compose

*Instructions:*

#. Clone the DefectDojo repository on GitHub:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      $ git clone https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo

#. Change directories into the newly created folder.

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      $ cd django-DefectDojo

#. Run Docker Compose:
        To run docker-DefectDojo and see the Dojo logs in the terminal, use:
        ``docker-compose up``
        To run docker-DefectDojo and get your terminal prompt back, use:
        ``docker-compose up -d``

#. Get the admin password by running:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

     $ container_id=(`docker ps -a \
     --filter "name=django-defectdojo_initializer_1" \
     | awk 'FNR == 2 {print $1}'`) && \
     docker logs $container_id 2>&1 | grep "Admin password:"

#. Navigate to https://localhost:8080 and login with 'admin' and the password displayed.

*Installation - Setup.bash is temporarily depricated. It is recommended you use the docker-compose install*

Change into the newly created ``django-DefectDojo`` directory:

.. code-block:: shell-session

        $ cd django-DefectDojo/

There is a script in the main folder called ``setup.bash`` that will allow you to interactively install DefectDojo on any Linux based systems. We do not recommend running DefectDojo as root, but you may do so if you choose.

**You will need:**
* MySQL
* pip

**Recommended**
* virtualenv

1. If you haven't already, run ``mysql_secure_install`` to set a password for your root MySQL user.

2. Create a MySQL user with CREATE privileges, or use root.

**Run the ``setup.bash`` script**
This script will:

1. Install all the operating system packages needed

2. Prompt for database connection information and create the necessary table

3. Install all python packages needed

4. Either ``makemigrations`` and ``migrate`` or ``syncdb`` depending on Django version installed.

5. Provide you with the commands needed to complete the installation

Install Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the script:

    ``./setup.bash``

During the execution you will be prompted for a few items:

    ``MySQL user (should already exist):``

Enter the user you created or `root` if you used ```mysql_secure_installation```

   ``Password for user:``

Enter the password for the MySQL user you selected.

    ``Database name (should NOT exist):``

Select a name for the DefectDojo database.

**All the packages**

It may take some time for all the `OS` and `python` packages to be installed. As of this writing the packages for this `OS` are:

* gcc
* libssl-dev
* python-dev
* libmysqlclient-dev
* python-pip
* mysql-server
* nodejs-legacy
* npm

The ``python`` packages are listed in ``requirements.txt``.

After all the components have been installed, the `makemigrations` process will prompt you to create a ``superuser``

.. code-block:: shell-session

   You have installed Django's auth system, and don't have any superusers defined.
   Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):

Answer `yes` and follow the prompts, this will be the user you will use to login to DefectDojo.

#. *(OPTIONAL)* If you haven't already, run `mysql_secure_install` to set a password for your root MySQL user.
#. Edit the settings.py file to modify any other settings that you want to change, such as your SMTP server information, which we leave off by default.
#. When you are ready to run DefectDojo, run the server with ``./run_dojo.bash``

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the DefectDojo settings and Django configurations in settings.py can be customized through the use of environment variables or a .env file.

DefectDojo currently uses `django-environ`_, which allows you to use the `Twelve-factor`_ methodology, to configure your Django application with environment variables.

.. _django-environ: https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ
.. _Twelve-factor: https://www.12factor.net/

Environment variables can be set from the os environment by setting the variable as follows: ``export DD_DEBUG=on`` or environment settings can be specified in a file in the dojo/settings/ folder or specify a different environment by setting DD_ENV_PATH with the name of the env file you wish to use, dev.env for example.

DefectDojo Environment Variables
--------------------------------

**Required Variables**

The following variables, at a minimum, must be set in order to start DefectDojo.

DD_SECRET_KEY
    A secret key for a particular Django installation. This is used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.

DD_CREDENTIAL_AES_256_KEY
    AES 256 key for encrypting sensitive data such as passwords in DefectDojo. Set to at least a 256-bit key and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.

DD_DEBUG
    DefectDojo by default has debug set to off. If testing locally then set DD_DEBUG=on.

    If debug is false then assets such as images will not served. If you want assets to be viewed then set DD_WHITENOISE=on.

    `WhiteNoise`_ allows your web app to serve its own static files, making it a self-contained unit that can be deployed anywhere without relying on nginx, Amazon S3 or any other external service. (Especially useful on Heroku, OpenShift and other PaaS providers.)

.. _WhiteNoise: http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/

DD_ALLOWED_HOSTS
    Hosts/domain names that are valid for this site; If DEBUG is False, default is localhost/127.0.0.1

DD_DATABASE_URL
    Database connections are expressed as URL's conforming to the 12factor approach

    * MySQL: mysql://user:password@host:port/database
    * MySQL example: ``export DD_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1:3306/dojodb``
    * PostgreSQL: postgres://, pgsql://, psql:// or postgresql://
    * SQLITE: sqlite://

**Sample env file**

``prod.env`` in ``dojo/settings/prod.env``:

.. code-block:: bash

    DEBUG=on
    DD_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
    DD_CREDENTIAL_AES_256_KEY=your-secret-aes-key
    DATABASE_URL=DD_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1:3306/dojodb
