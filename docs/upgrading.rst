Upgrading
=========

The easiest way to upgrade to a new version of DefectDojo is to pull from Github.  Assuming the source code lives in a
directory named `defect-dojo` you can complete the following steps to upgrade to the latest DefectDojo release.::

    cd defect-dojo
    git checkout master
    git pull
    pip freeze > pip_frozen.txt
    pip install -r pip_frozen.txt --upgrade
    ./manage.py makemigrations dojo
    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate

Because yarn assets change from time to time, it is always a good idea to re-install them and collect the static
resources. ::

    cd defect-dojo
    cd components
    yarn
    cd ..

At this point yarn may ask you to select from different versions of packages, choose the latest on each.

Next you can run: ::

    ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput

If you are in your production system, you will need to restart gunicorn and celery to make sure the latest code is
being used by both.

**Upgrading to 1.5.0 requirements:**

1. Back up your database first, ideally take the backup from production and test the upgrade on a staging server.

2. Edit the settings.py file which can be found in ``django-DefectDojo/dojo/settings/settings.py``. Copy in the rest framework configuration after the CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True::

    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
            'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
            'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        ),
        'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
            'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissions',
        ),
        'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
            'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
        ),
        'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination',
        'PAGE_SIZE': 25
    }

Navigate to: LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS and add the following after r'^%sfinding/image/(?P<token>[^/]+)$' % URL_PREFIX::

    r'^%sfinding/image/(?P<token>[^/]+)$' % URL_PREFIX,
    r'^%sapi/v2/' % URL_PREFIX,

Navigate to: INSTALLED_APPS and add the following after: 'multiselectfield',::

    'multiselectfield',
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'rest_framework_swagger',
    'dbbackup',

Navigate to: 	CELERY_TASK_IGNORE_RESULT = True and add the following after CELERY_TASK_IGNORE_RESULT line::

    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'db+sqlite:///dojo.celeryresults.sqlite'

Save your modified settings file. For reference the modified file should look like the new 1.5.0 [settings](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/settings/settings.dist.py) file, minus the environmental configurations. As an alternative this file can be used and the enviromental configurations from you environment can be copied into this file.

3. Activate your virtual environment and then upgrade the requirements:

``pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade``

4. Upgrade the database::

    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate

5. Collect the static files (Javascript, Images, CSS)::

    ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput

6. Complete

July 6th 2017 - New location for system settings
------------------------------------------------

Pull request #313 moves a number of system settings previously located in the application's settings.py
to a model that can be used and changed within the web application under "Configuration -> System Settings".

If you're using a custom ``URL_PREFIX`` you will need to set this in the model after upgrading by
editing ``dojo/fixtures/system_settings.json`` and setting your URL prefix in the ``url_prefix`` value there.
Then issue the command ``./manage.py loaddata system_settings.json`` to load your settings into the database.

If you're not using a custom ``URL_PREFIX``, after upgrading simply go to the System Settings page and review
which values you want to set for each setting, as they're not automatically migrated from settings.py.

If you like you can then remove the following settings from settings.py to avoid confusion:

* ``ENABLE_DEDUPLICATION``
* ``ENABLE_JIRA``
* ``S_FINDING_SEVERITY_NAMING``
* ``URL_PREFIX``
* ``TIME_ZONE``
* ``TEAM_NAME``

Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.2.2
-------------------------------------

Upgrading to 1.2.2 requires:

1. Copying settings.py to the settings/ folder.

2. If you have supervisor scripts change DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=dojo.settings.settings

Upgrading to Django 1.1.5
-------------------------
If you are upgrading an existing version of DefectDojo, you will need to run the following commands manually:

#. First install Yarn.
   Follow the instructions based on your OS: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

#. The following must be removed/commented out from ``settings.py``: ::

    'djangobower.finders.BowerFinder',

    From the line that contains:
    # where should bower install components
    ...

    To the end of the bower declarations
      'justgage'
    )

#. The following needs to be updated in ``settings.py``: ::

    STATICFILES_DIRS = (
        # Put strings here, like "/home/html/static" or "C:/www/django/static".
        # Always use forward slashes, even on Windows.
        # Don't forget to use absolute paths, not relative paths.
        os.path.dirname(DOJO_ROOT) + "/components/yarn_components",
    )

Upgrading to Django 1.11
------------------------

Pull request #300 makes DefectDojo Django 1.11 ready. A fresh install of DefectDojo can be done with the setup.bash script included - no special steps are required.

If you are upgrading an existing installation of DefectDojo, you will need to run the following commands manually: ::

    pip install django-tastypie --upgrade
    pip install django-tastypie-swagger --upgrade
    pip install django-filter --upgrade
    pip install django-watson --upgrade
    pip install django-polymorphic --upgrade
    pip install django --upgrade
    pip install pillow --upgrade
    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate

The following must be removed/commented out from settings.py: ::

    TEMPLATE_DIRS
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG
    TEMPLATE_LOADERS
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS

The following needs to be added to settings.py: ::

    TEMPLATES  = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
    ]

Once all these steps are completed your installation of DefectDojo will be running under Django 1.11
